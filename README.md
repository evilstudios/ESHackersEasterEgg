ESHackersEasterEgg
==================

An Easter Egg providing the full Hackers experience. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/

* One call the Hackers experience: `displayHackersEasterEgg`
* One output value: `hackersEasterEggDidComplete:(BOOL)complete` (do we need `withError:`?)

Discussion:

* Should this repo be written in Objective-C, or Swift? Swift could be a sweet PR move.
* Full screen, or modal with faded background?
